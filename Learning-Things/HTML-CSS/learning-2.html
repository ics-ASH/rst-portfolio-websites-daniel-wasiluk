    <h1>Learning HTML Day 2</h1>
    <p> Yesterday I used <a href ="w3schools.com/html"> w3schools HTML lessons</a> to learn about some basic HTML. I learned up until HTML Formatting. <br> Below I will just write randomly while I am learning, in order to have somewhere to reference the code that I am learning.</p>
    <h2>HTML Quotations</h2>
    <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
        For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
    </blockquote>
    <p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>
    <p> When using an abbreviation, such as <abbr title="Natinoal Basketball Association">NBA</abbr>, we can use the <b> abbr</b>. </p>
    
    <p> Below I am going to use the address take, with br tags to create this address text:</p>
    <address>
        Written by John Doe.<br>
        Visit us at:<br>
        Example.com<br>
        Box 564, Disneyland<br>
        USA
    </address>
    <p> As you can see, that is simply and utterly art. </p>
    <p> Something that I find interesting is that you can use the bidirectional overdrive in order to change the direction of the text that is being printed.</p>
    <bdo dir="rtl"> This text is being written left to write.</bdo>
